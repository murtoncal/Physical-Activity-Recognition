# Physical-Activity-Recognition
A project investigating how modern physical activity recognition (PAR) is conducted. This includes assessing the implications of cost-effective and wearable activity recognition and exploring areas of the field where standardisation has the potential to be enhanced. 
## Datasets
UCI_HAR - https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/240/human+activity+recognition+using+smartphones <br />

## Python Libraries
Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Keras, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn and PyTorch.
## File Structure
There are four files detailing all the code written for this project. One data preprocessing file. Three experimental files (one for each dataset), personal CNN-based feature extraction to classify the desired physical activities.
